# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

Welcome to the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** experience! This repository hosts a simple yet engaging implementation of the beloved 3-in-a-row game. Challenge your friends or hone your strategy against an AI – the choice is yours!

## ✨ Features

* intuitve user interface.
* Two-player mode for head-to-head battles 🤝.
* Clearly defined game states (win, lose, draw).
* Responsive and enjoyable gameplay.
* A perfect project for beginners to dive into game development fundamentals. 🚀

## 🛠️ Technologies & Technical Deep Dive

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is primarily built with:

* **[Language/Framework Used - e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.]:** The core logic and game engine are meticulously crafted using [mention your primary language/framework, e.g., Python]. Its simplicity and readability allowed for a clean and maintainable codebase.
* **[Any UI Library/Framework - e.g., Tkinter, Pygame, React, HTML/CSS/JS]:** For the graphical user interface, we leverage [mention your UI library/framework, e.g., Tkinter for Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web]. This provides the interactive visual elements and handles user input events.
    * **Event-Driven Architecture:** The game heavily relies on an event-driven programming paradigm. User clicks on the game board trigger specific events that update the game state, reflecting changes in the UI.
    * **Game State Management:** A robust state management system is implemented to track the current board configuration, active player, and game status (ongoing, win, draw). This typically involves a 2D array or similar data structure to represent the board.
    * **Winning Condition Logic:** Efficient algorithms are in place to check for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals after each move. This often involves iterative checks and conditional logic.
    * **Modular Design:** The codebase is structured with a focus on modularity, separating concerns such as game logic, UI rendering, and input handling into distinct functions or classes. This enhances readability and maintainability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

* [Mention any prerequisites, e.g., Python 3.x, Node.js, a specific browser, etc.]

### Installation

A step-by-step guide to get your development environment running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/tic-tac-toe.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/tic-tac-toe.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe
    ```
3.  **[Optional] Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # If using Python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # If using Node.js
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    # If using Python
    python main.py  # Or whatever your main script is called
    # If using HTML/CSS/JS, simply open index.html in your browser
    ```

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  Launch the game.
2.  Players take turns clicking on an empty cell on the 3x3 board.
3.  The first player to get three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
4.  If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
